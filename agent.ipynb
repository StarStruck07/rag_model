While it's not an IIT, it's a well-regarded institution in the field of engineering.\n",
      "2. **International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B)**: IIIT-B is a highly-regarded institute that offers a range of technical programs, including CS and ECE. With your expected rank, you may have a good chance of getting admission into this prestigious institute.\n",
      "3. **Delhi Technological University**: DTU is a well-established university in Delhi that offers a wide range of engineering programs, including CS, ECE, and other technical branches. With a rank of around 5000, you may be eligible for admission into this university.\n",
